Running the Server
1. Development Server (Local Development)
The development server is optimized for speed of coding with features like hot-reloading but may be slower to render pages compared to the production build.

Steps:

npm install

npm run dev


2. Production Server (Deployment Ready)
The production environment serves the optimized, static build for maximum performance. Dependencies must be installed first.

Steps:

npm install

npm run build

npm start
